Finance::Quote for Google and TDBank
====================================

This package contains add-ons to Finance::Quote to allow it to obtain quotes 
from Google Finance and from TD Bank.  (The existing tdwaterhouse and tdefunds
modules don't work.)  They are known to work with Finance::Quote 1.20.

The current version of Finance::Quote can be obtained from 
<https://github.com/finance-quote/finance-quote>.

To install, first install Finance::Quote, then copy Google.pm and TDBank.pm to 
Finance::Quote's install directory (likely something like 
/usr/local/share/perl5/Finance/Quote/), then edit Quote.pm (likely 
/usr/local/share/perl5/Finance/Quote.pm) to add "Google" and "TDBank" to 
"@modules".

To run unit tests, first install then run test_google.pl and test_tdbank.pl.
